# Wiringbits Web Application Utils

This is the Wiringbits Web Application Utils library, which we re-use in many of our Scala Web App projects.

The main usage can be seen in our [webapp template](https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template)

Right now, this is experimental and you shouldn't use it unless you need a piece of code from it which you reviewed.
